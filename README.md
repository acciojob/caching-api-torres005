# Caching API

Your web application frequently requests data from a third-party API. To minimize the number of API calls and improve performance, you decide to cache the data. Implement a `cache system` using JavaScript that stores the API response for a given period and serves it from the cache for subsequent requests within that period.

`X-RapidAPI-Host`: `financialmarketdata.p.rapidapi.com`

## Instructions

1. If an api call is made log in the console that the `Making API call`
2. If website used cached data and didnâ€™t make call to api then log `Serving data from cache`
3. Basic HTML and CSS is given to you, just implement JS.
4. The stored cache duration should be `1 min`. This means after a min, new request should be sent
